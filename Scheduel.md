The purpose of this doc is to record the talks I plan to attend and have attended (planned is marked below, see my schedule for latest (subject to change up to start of talk)  
If the Time is a link, then i attended the talk, and I took notes. Lack of a link means i skipped it for some reason (not feeling well/brain overload) or i had no notes to take.  

__At the moment, almost all slides are not published for me to share__  
__But i have prepared an area of all the documents for slides to be entered, (3rd line from top)__

If you awnt to see my schedule in more details, you can go [here][MyScheduel].
