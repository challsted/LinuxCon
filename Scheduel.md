The purpose of this doc is to record the talks I plan to attend and have attended (planned is marked below, see my schedule for latest (subject to change up to start of talk)  
If the Time is a link, then i attended the talk, and I took notes. Lack of a link means i skipped it for some reason (not feeling well/brain overload) or i had no notes to take.  

__Slides are available for all breakoff sessions, im having trouble finding videos/slides for keynotes__
