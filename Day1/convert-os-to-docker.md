# Converting existing Installed OS and Applications to Docker
## Speaker [Marc Merlin][MarcEmail] (Google)
### Slides can be found [here][Slides]

Slides include all deatils, live example didnt add any additional info
Little actual info can be gleemed from this, the guy hacked docker appart to do what he needed it to, he was very very smart, but his whole talk was pointless to 99% of its atendees (most all of us (includeing me) left before it was done).
