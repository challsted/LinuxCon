Bruce was unable to attend, he spoke over Google Hangouts,  
Its hard to take notes, and im not sure if they will be available

He is primarily talking about the Sony Attack,  
He points out that in a physical attack, or an attack of war, you can see the enemy, and you know who/where your attack is coming from.  
In a cyber attack you have no idea who/where/why an attack is happening.  
He points out that a companys security is owned by said company, not by anyone else  
He points out that Computer Spying and Computer Attacks (destruction of property) are exactly the same except the end goal (copy data or delete data)
