# Extreme Agile
### Speaker Alan Bennett
### Slides are available [here][Slides]

This guy is super dry, almost monotone...  
At least for me, this is very uninformitive, its basic concepts of how a team went from waterfall to kanban  
slides are slightly informative though, but very customized to the speakers team he managed
