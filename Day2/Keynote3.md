This **is not** the year of the linux desktop, this **is** the year of the application (running on linux)  
The role of the OS is changing: 
* From Physical to Virtual
* From Local to Cloud
* From \*VM to Continer

"Build once deploy anywhere"
* Physical
* Virtual
* Continer
* Cloud

Debugging an app inside of a continer is hard, and there is a lack of tools to do so  
Applications sometimes rely on low level system things
