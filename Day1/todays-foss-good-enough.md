# Are Todays FOSS Security Practices Robust Enough in the Cloud Era?
## [Lars Kurth][Lars_Twitter] (Citrix/Xen)
### Slides Will Be Available [Here][Slides]

Projects should have a security@project type email, there is nothing stoping a bug discoverer from spreading the knowledge of your bug if you dont have a way to accept the bug and even if you do, not doing anything (or fast enough) is also bad (for example MS and Apple taking too long to release patches that were passed to them by google)  

Personal Note: Checkout "War Storys" slide's link  
Personal Note: Get mailing list link from 2012 Xen Issue [Link][2012WarStory]
