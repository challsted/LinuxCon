# LinuxCon
[LinuxCon][LinuxCon], [ContinerCon][ContinerCon] and [CloudOpen][CloudOpen] Notes

This is simply a place to take notes (all in MarkDown) while im at the convention and to share all materials gained with everyone else that wants to see what im doing :D (live and later) 

The Schedule will include linux to each lesson as as soon as i can (so you will have a clue what the lesson is about)

Please note all will be taken in markdown, so you can convert it to HTML as you please, (or view via the github page which live converts to MD) 

Also, please note that i am fully aware taht i cannot spell, my grammer is terrible, and my sentence scructure is terrible. Consider all of this a "rought draft" for those who want early access to what im doing. Ill work to get a grammer checked and pretty version working as soon as possible on on my blog.
